Build instructions
------------------

A [gradle](http://www.gradle.org/) wrapper is bundled with the sources. To
build and run the project one can simply run `./gradlew run` in the project
root. Note that you don't need to install gradle to use this functionality.

For other possible build tasks run `./gradlew tasks`.

Usage notes
-----------

To log in supply the database url with `jdbc:mysql://` as a prefix. Only
MySQL databases are supported at this time.
