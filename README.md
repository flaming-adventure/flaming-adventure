Build instructions
------------------

A [gradle](http://www.gradle.org/) wrapper is bundled with the sources. To
build and run the project one can simply run `./gradlew run` in the project
root. Note that you don't need to install gradle to use this functionality.

For other possible build tasks run `./gradlew tasks`.
